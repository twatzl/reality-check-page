## To Bring
* We provide you with all the infrastructure, e.g. LAN cable, tables etc.
* You have to bring your own PC and gaming equipment!
* Make sure to install large games you plan on playing beforehand to limit the strain on our infrastructure.
* Your own powerstrip (Verteiler) might come in handy as well.
